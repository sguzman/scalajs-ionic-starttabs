#Scala/Ionic Starter Template

##scalajs-ionic-starttabs
==================

An experimental HTML5 mobile application that puts together the following libraries :
- **scala-js** to compile scala to javascript (see http://www.scala-js.org/)
- **Ionic** framework that brings an angular based mobile framework (see http://ionicframework.com/)
- **scala-js-angular** that provides Angular bindings (see https://github.com/greencatsoft/scalajs-angular)
- **scalatags** that provides a way to "compile" scala code to HTML files (see https://github.com/lihaoyi/scalatags) ( a SBT task has been specially devised to do so)

A live demo is available at http://olivergg.github.io/scalajs-ionic-starttabs/www/index-prod.html

You will need to install the Ionic framework first (see http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).

This application aims to be almost equivalent to the one created with : ```ionic start XXXXXXX tabs```

There are several things you can customize in the Build.scala file :
```
 // the output folder for the generated scala-js javascript files (and jsdeps and launcher and SourceMaps)
 lazy val outputCompiledJS = new File("ionic/www/js")
 // the output folder for the generated HTML files
 lazy val outputCompiledHTML = new File("ionic/www")
 // the input package folder that will be scanned to find scala files compilable to HTML
 lazy val htmlScalaSourceDir = "com/olivergg/html"
```

To start development :

```
sbt 
~fastOptJS
```

To compile scala files in the html package (`htmlScalaSourceDir`) to HTML files :
```
compileHtmlDevTask
```
during development or
```
compileHtmlProdTask
```
for production.

**Note : since ScalaTags is only a dependency of the app-jvm project, you can't put HtmlCompilable objects in the shared project, unless you add ScalaTags as a dependency of the app-js project as well**


then, to run the app in the browser, you can use ionic built-in command
```
cd ionic
ionic serve
```
(see http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/testing.html)

To create the fully optimized javascript version of the application (and to remove developement files (fastopt js, source maps, etc.)) :

```
dist
```
`dist` is just an alias to 
`";cleanOutputJS ;packageJSDependencies ;packageScalaJSLauncher ;compileHtmlProdTask ;fullOptJS"`

Then, you can use :

```
ionic run
```
to launch the application on a connected device

TODO

- ~~Use yet to be created scala-js bindings for the Cordova API~~ NOT SURE, see the ngCordova TODO below
- ~~Improve bindings for angular-ui-router (that should be merged with scalajs-angular)
- Improve bindings for ionic specific services (that should be put in a separate project)
- Use ngCordova to communicate with the cordova API
- Improve the documentation in this README and in the code.
- ~~use webjar to include ionic framework (only the javascript part of the framework).~~
- ~~find a way to generate index-dev.html and index.html (for fastOptJS and fullOptJS) automatically.~~
- ~~Use cross building (see http://www.scala-js.org/doc/sbt/cross-building.html) to put the HtmlCompilable trait in a JVM project (to prevent them from being included in the output JS).~~
- Use the shared directory to share code between the template scala files and the controllers/views.
- Test on iPhone/iPad devices (this only has been tested with Android).


FIXME 
- ~~The back button does not close the application on android (4.1) (must be related to the cordova API)~~
- ~~Performance issue with a OnePlusOne device see http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/scrolling-and-animations-in-android-emulator-really-slow/1132/16~~ => animation have been removed to circumvent this issue
